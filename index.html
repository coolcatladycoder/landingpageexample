  <section id="about"></section>
  <br>Better Days Brewing is an Boston Based Brewey located in the Seaport District. At Better Days Brewing we know that nothing makes a day better then a good brew.
Better Days Brewing was started by two brothers- Ted and Bill. The first Better Days Brewing was located in Ted's garage. At first Ted and Bill brewed beer for family and friends. Soon they realized that they wanted to turn their passion into a career.
  They went to a local beer festival in Seaport and got rave reveiws. They also earned their first award for best new beer by a new brewery. 
  The two brothers contiuned their work. They have picked up a few more awards. Their Hazey Crazy Beer got a "Gold Standard" award in the Hazey Beer category. They were also named "Brewery to Watch" by Alehouse Magazine. They perfected their porcess. They also spend a lot of nights and days and weekends in that garage until they finally opened up a brewery in the Seaport district.
  What about now? Now the two brothers brew over fifteen different beers. They compete in mutiple competetions across the country. We hope you enjoy our beer.</p>
